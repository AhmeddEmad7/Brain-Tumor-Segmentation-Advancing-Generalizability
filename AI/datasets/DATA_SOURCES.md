# Raw Datasets Sources

This directory is intended to provide information and downloadable links for the raw datasets used in this project. Due to their large size, the actual dataset files are **not** committed directly to this Git repository. Instead, they are hosted externally.

Below are the online sources for the raw datasets for each of the 5 populations. For local execution, you will need to download these datasets manually from the provided links and place them in the appropriate local directories as configured in your project's setup (e.g., in a `datasets/raw/POPULATION_data` directory) or use them in a Kaggle or Colab environment.
