# Brain Tumor Segmentation Platform – Technical Documentation

## 1. Platform Overview

An advanced, microservices-based medical imaging platform designed to support AI-powered brain tumor analysis through DICOM/NIfTI visualization, automated segmentation, real-time interaction, and clinical reporting.

## 2. Technology Stack

### Frontend

* **React 18**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**
* Medical Viewer: **Cornerstone3D**, **VTK.js**

### Backend Services

* **API Gateway**: Django
* **Inference Service**: Django
* **Reporting Service**: FastAPI
* **NIfTI Storage Service**: FastAPI
* **Orthanc PACS**: DICOM storage, retrieval, and web services

### Infrastructure

* **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
* **Database**: PostgreSQL
* **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ
* **Cache**: Redis

## 3. Service Communication and Integration

### API Gateway (Django)

* Acts as the single point of contact for the frontend
* Forwards requests to microservices: segmentation, reporting, nifti storage
* Handles authentication, routing, and permission validation

### Inference Service (Django)

* Consumes DICOM/NIfTI images via RabbitMQ
* Applies segmentation model (ONNX/PyTorch-based)
* Outputs segmentation mask (DICOM-SEG, NIfTI)
* Publishes metadata to Redis for reporting and visualization

### Reporting Service (FastAPI)

* Accepts structured content and metadata
* Generates editable, LLM-assisted PDF reports
* Supports clinical sections: Findings, Impression, Diagnosis, Recommendations
* Integrates screenshot and measurement metadata

### NIfTI Storage Service (FastAPI)

* BIDS-compliant file handling
* Exposes REST endpoints to upload, retrieve, and organize `.nii`/`.nii.gz` files
* Converts and links to segmentation and viewer pipelines

### Orthanc PACS (DICOM Web)

* Handles storage/retrieval of DICOM & DICOM-SEG
* Supports WADO-RS, QIDO-RS, STOW-RS for web-based integration
* Provides anonymization and caching mechanisms

### Redis & RabbitMQ

* Redis: Stores transient AI results and session state
* RabbitMQ: Handles async task distribution for inference and processing jobs

## 4. Data Flow Example

1. User uploads DICOM study via API Gateway
2. API Gateway registers study in PostgreSQL and Orthanc
3. Segmentation task sent via RabbitMQ to Inference Service
4. Inference returns mask → stored in NIfTI/Orthanc → metadata pushed to Redis
5. Reporting service fetches metadata and auto-generates clinical report
6. PDF report returned to frontend via API Gateway

## 5. Deployment and Configuration

### Environment Setup

* Each service runs in its own Docker container
* Environment variables for ports, secrets, and endpoints are defined in `.env` files
* Docker Compose ensures service orchestration and volume sharing

### Security

* Role-based access via JWT tokens
* Secure endpoints with HTTPS (via reverse proxy or gateway)
* API keys for inter-service communication
* HIPAA-aligned architecture with encryption for sensitive data

### Monitoring

* Healthcheck endpoints in FastAPI/Django services
* Container logs centralized via Docker logging drivers
* Planned integration with Prometheus + Grafana

## 6. Development Notes

* Code follows MVC/service-based separation
* APIs are RESTful with OpenAPI documentation (FastAPI)
* Frontend dynamically queries volume and segmentation data

## 7. Future Enhancements

* Move to Kubernetes for scalable deployments
* Integrate MLflow or Weights & Biases for model versioning
* LLM feedback refinement loop (fine-tuning recommendations)
* Add audit logs and real-time admin dashboard
